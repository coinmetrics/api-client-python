Installation and Updates \u00b6 To install the client you can run the following command: pip install coinmetrics-api-client Note that the client is updated regularly to reflect the changes made in API v4 . Ensure that your latest version matches with what's in pyPI To update your version, run the following command: pip install coinmetrics-api-client -U Introduction \u00b6 You can use this client for querying all kinds of data with your API. To initialize the client you should use your API key, and the CoinMetricsClient class like the following. from coinmetrics.api_client import CoinMetricsClient client = CoinMetricsClient(\"<cm_api_key>\") # or to use community API: client = CoinMetricsClient() After that you can use the client object for getting information such as available markets: print(client.catalog_markets()) or to query all available assets along with what is available for those assets, like metrics, markets: print(client.catalog_assets()) you can also use filters for the catalog endpoints like this: print(client.catalog_assets(assets=['btc'])) in this case you would get all the information for btc only. You can use this client to connect to our API v4 and get catalog or timeseries data from python environment. It natively supports paging over the data so you can use it to iterate over timeseries entries seamlessly. The client can be used to query both pro and community data. The full list of methods can be found in the API Client Spec . If you'd like a more wholistic view of what is offered from an API endpoint you can use the to_dataframe() function associated with our catalog endpoints. The code snippet below shows getting a dataframe of information on all the assets that data is provided for: print ( client . catalog_assets () . to_dataframe ()) Output: asset full_name exchanges ... metrics atlas experimental 0 100x 100xCoin [gate.io] ...

NaN <NA> <NA> Now you can use the pandas Dataframe functionality to do useful transformations, such as filtering out the assets without metrics available, then saving that data to a csv file: catalog_assets_df = client . catalog_assets () . to_dataframe () only_assets_with_metrics = catalog_assets_df . dropna ( subset = [ 'metrics' ]) only_assets_with_metrics . to_csv ( \"cm_assets_with_metrics.csv\" ) You may notice that in that data saved, the \"metrics\" column for example is a list of json data describing the metrics offered and the frequency at which they are available. To help parse this information there is a keyword for all catalog endpoint data secondary_level : catalog_assets_df = client . catalog_assets () . to_dataframe ( secondary_level = \"metrics\" ) only_assets_with_metrics = catalog_assets_df . dropna ( subset = [ 'metric' ]) eth_metrics = only_assets_with_metrics [ only_assets_with_metrics [ 'asset' ] == \"eth\" ] eth_metrics . to_csv ( \"eth_metrics_granular.csv\" ) The above example queries for eth metrics at the level of metrics and frequency, where it will have one row for each metric and frequency related to Ethereum. This allows users to quickly get high level information about exactly what is offered from the Coin Metrics API and to make custom queries against the API from there. This example only covers catalog_assets() , but the pattern can be used across all of our catalog endpoints. Examples \u00b6 The API Client allows you to chain together workflows for importing, transforming, then exporting Coin Metrics data. Below are examples of common use-cases that can be altered to tailor your specific needs. In addition to the examples listed below, there's examples covering all the API methods, found in the examples directory . Example Notebooks walkthrough_community.ipynb : Walks through the basic functionality available using the community client. Asset Metrics bbb_metrics_csv_exporter_using_plain_requests.py : Queries block-by-block metrics using the requests library and exports the output into a CSV file. bbb_metrics_json_exporter.py : Queries block-by-block metrics and exports the output into a JSON file. eod_metrics_csv_exporter.py : Exports a set of user-defined metrics and assets published at end-of-day and exports the output into a CSV file. reference_rates_json_exporter.py : Queries Coin Metrics Reference Rates at a user-defined frequency for a set of assets, then exports the output into a JSON file. Market Data books_json_exporter.py : Queries market orderbook data then exports the output into a JSON file. candles_json_exporter.py : Queries market candles data then exports the output into a JSON file. funding_rates_json_exporter.py : Queries market funding rates data then exports the output into a JSON file. trades_csv_exporter.py : Queries market trades data then exports the output into a CSV file. trades_json_exporter.py : Queries market trades data then exports the output into a JSON file. Getting timeseries data \u00b6 For getting timeseries data you want to use methods of the client class that start with get_ . For example if you want to get a bunch of market data trades for coinbase btc-usd pair you can run something similar to the following: for trade in client.get_market_trades( markets='coinbase-btc-usd-spot', start_time='2020-01-01', end_time='2020-01-03', limit_per_market=10 ): print(trade) Or if you want to see daily btc asset metrics you can use something like this: for metric_data in client.get_asset_metrics(assets='btc', metrics=['ReferenceRateUSD', 'BlkHgt', 'AdrActCnt', 'AdrActRecCnt', 'FlowOutBFXUSD'], frequency='1d', limit_per_asset=10): print(metric_data) This will print you the requested metrics for all the days where we have any of the metrics present. DataFrames \u00b6 (New in >= 2021.9.30.14.30 ) Timeseries data can be transformed into a pandas dataframe by using the to_dataframe() method. The code snippet below shows how: import pandas as pd from coinmetrics.api_client import CoinMetricsClient from os import environ client = CoinMetricsClient() trades = client.get_market_trades( markets='coinbase-btc-usd-spot', start_time='2021-09-19T00:00:00Z', limit_per_market=10 ) trades_df = trades.to_dataframe() print(trades_df.head()) If you want to use dataframes, then you will need to install pandas Notes This only works with requests that return the type DataCollection . Thus, catalog requests, which return lists cannot be returned as dataframes. Please see the API Client Spec for a full list of requests and their return types. API restrictions apply. Some requests may return empty results due to limited access to the API from you API key. Type Conversion \u00b6 (New in >= 2021.12.17.18.00 ) As of version 2021.12.17.18.00 or later, outputs from the to_dataframe function automatically convert the dtypes for a dataframe to the optimal pandas types. metrics_list = [ 'volume_trusted_spot_usd_1d' , 'SplyFF' , 'AdrBalUSD1Cnt' ] asset_list = [ 'btc' , 'xmr' ] start_time = '2021-12-01' df_metrics = client . get_asset_metrics ( assets = asset_list , metrics = metrics_list , start_time = start_time , limit_per_asset = 3 ) . to_dataframe () print ( df_metrics . dtypes ) asset string time datetime64[ns, tzutc()] AdrBalUSD1Cnt Int64 SplyFF Float64 volume_trusted_spot_usd_1d Float64 dtype: object This can be turned off by setting optimize_pandas_types=False Alternatively, you can manually enter your own type conversion by passing in a dictionary for dtype_mapper . This can be done in conjunction with pandas' built in type optimizations. mapper = { 'SplyFF' : 'Float64' , 'AdrBalUSD1Cnt' : 'Int64' , } df_mapped = client . get_asset_metrics ( assets = asset_list , metrics = metrics_list , start_time = start_time , limit_per_asset = 3 ) . to_dataframe ( dtype_mapper = mapper , optimize_pandas_types = True ) print ( df_mapped . dtypes ) asset object time datetime64[ns, tzutc()] AdrBalUSD1Cnt Int64 SplyFF Float64 volume_trusted_spot_usd_1d float64 dtype: object Or as strictly the only types in the dataframe dtype_mapper = { 'ReferenceRateUSD' : np . float64 , 'time' : np . datetime64 } df = client . get_asset_metrics ( assets = 'btc' , metrics = 'ReferenceRateUSD' , start_time = '2022-06-15' , limit_per_asset = 1 ) . to_dataframe ( dtype_mapper = dtype_mapper , optimize_pandas_types = False ) df . info () RangeIndex: 1 entries, 0 to 0 Data columns (total 3 columns): # Column Non-Null Count Dtype --- ------ -------------- ----- 0 asset 1 non-null object 1 time 1 non-null datetime64[ns] 2 ReferenceRateUSD 1 non-null float64 dtypes: datetime64[ns](1), float64(1), object(1) memory usage: 152.0+ bytes Note that in order to pass a custom datetime object, setting a dtype_mapper is mandatory. Pandas type conversion tends to be more performant. But if there are custom operations that must be done using numpy datatypes, this option will let you perform them. Paging \u00b6 You can make the datapoints to iterate from start (default) or from end. for that you should use a paging_from argument like the following: from coinmetrics.api_client import CoinMetricsClient from coinmetrics.constants import PagingFrom client = CoinMetricsClient() for metric_data in client.get_asset_metrics(assets='btc', metrics=['ReferenceRateUSD'], paging_from=PagingFrom.START): print(metric_data) PagingFrom.END: is available but by default it will page from the start. Debugging the API Client \u00b6 There are two additional options for the API Client - debug_mode and verbose . These two options log network calls to the console, and in the case of debug_mode it will generate a log file of all the network requests and the time it takes to call them. These tools can be used to diagnose issues in your code and also to get a better understanding of request times so that users can write more performant code. For example, running the below code: import os from coinmetrics.api_client import CoinMetricsClient api_key = os . environ [ 'CM_API_KEY' ] if __name__ == '__main__' : client = CoinMetricsClient ( api_key = api_key , debug_mode = True ) reference_rates_example = client . get_asset_metrics ( assets = [ 'btc' , 'algo' , 'eth' ], metrics = [ 'ReferenceRateUSD' ]) for data in reference_rates_example : continue The console output will look like: [DEBUG] 2023-01-09 11:01:02,044 - Starting API Client debugging session. logging to stdout and cm_api_client_debug_2023_01_09_11_01_02.txt [DEBUG] 2023-01-09 11:01:02,044 - Using coinmetrics version 2022.11.14.16 [DEBUG] 2023-01-09 11:01:02,044 - Current state of API Client, excluding API KEY: {'_verify_ssl_certs': True, '_api_base_url': 'https://api.coinmetrics.io/v4', '_ws_api_base_url': 'wss://api.coinmetrics.io/v4', '_http_header': {'Api-Client-Version': '2022.11.14.16'}, '_proxies': {'http': None, 'https': None}, 'debug_mode': True, 'verbose': False} [DEBUG] 2023-01-09 11:01:02,044 - Attempting to call url: timeseries/asset-metrics with params: {'assets': ['btc', 'algo', 'eth'], 'metrics': ['ReferenceRateUSD'], 'frequency': None, 'page_size': None, 'paging_from': 'start', 'start_time': None, 'end_time': None, 'start_height': None, 'end_height': None, 'start_inclusive': None, 'end_inclusive': None, 'timezone': None, 'sort': None, 'limit_per_asset': None} [DEBUG] 2023-01-09 11:01:02,387 - Response status code: 200 for url: https://api.coinmetrics.io/v4/timeseries/asset-metrics?api_key=[REDACTED]&assets=btc%2Calgo%2Ceth&metrics=ReferenceRateUSD&paging_from=start took: 0:00:00.342874 response body size (bytes): 9832 [DEBUG] 2023-01-09 11:01:02,388 - Attempting to call url: timeseries/asset-metrics with params: {'assets': ['btc', 'algo', 'eth'], 'metrics': ['ReferenceRateUSD'], 'frequency': None, 'page_size': None, 'paging_from': 'start', 'start_time': None, 'end_time': None, 'start_height': None, 'end_height': None, 'start_inclusive': None, 'end_inclusive': None, 'timezone': None, 'sort': None, 'limit_per_asset': None, 'next_page_token': '0.MjAxOS0wOS0zMFQwMDowMDowMFo'} [DEBUG] 2023-01-09 11:01:02,559 - Response status code: 200 for url: https://api.coinmetrics.io/v4/timeseries/asset-metrics?api_key=[REDACTED]&assets=btc%2Calgo%2Ceth&metrics=ReferenceRateUSD&paging_from=start&next_page_token=0.MjAxOS0wOS0zMFQwMDowMDowMFo took: 0:00:00.171487 response body size (bytes): 9857 Then it can be easier to understand what network calls the API Client is making, and where any issues may exist. If you wish to dig even deeper, you may consider modifying the _send_request() method of the API Client to log additional data about the state of your environment, or anything else that would help diagnose issues. You will notice a log file generated in the format cm_api_client_debug_2023_01_09_11_01_02.txt . This log file might be helpful for your own use or to give more context if you are working with Coin Metrics customer success. SSL Certs verification \u00b6 Sometimes your organization network have special rules on SSL certs verification and in this case you might face the following error when running the script: SSLError: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='api.coinmetrics.io', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: <some_url_path> (Caused by SSLError(SSLCertVerificationError(1, '[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: self signed certificate in certificate chain (_ssl.c:1123)'))) In this case, you can pass an option during client initialization to disable ssl verification for requests like this: client = CoinMetricsClient ( verify_ssl_certs = False ) We don't recommend setting it to False by default and you should make sure you understand the security risks of disabling SSL certs verification. Additionally, you may choose to specify the path to the SSL certificates on your machine. This may cause errors where Python is unable to locate the certificates on your machine, particularly when using Python virtual environments. from coinmetrics.api_client import CoinMetricsClient SSL_CERT_LOCATION = '/Users/<USER_NAME>/Library/Python/3.8/lib/python/site-packages/certifi/cacert.pem' client = CoinMetricsClient ( verify_ssl_certs = SSL_CERT_LOCATION ) A quick way to find the certs on your machine is: python3 -c \"import requests; print(requests.certs.where())\" And note that this will change based on whether or not you are using a Python virtual environment or not Installing and running coinmetrics package and other python packages behind a secure python network \u00b6 Related to SSL Certs verification, you may have trouble installing and updating PyPi packages to your local environment. So you may need to choose the best solution for your company and environment - either using package managers or installing offline. Installing using package managers \u00b6 Full instructions for setting up your environment to use conda, pip, yarn, npm, etc. can be found here . Additionally, a workaround to disable SSL verification when installing a trusted Python package is this: pip install --trusted-host pypi.python.org <packagename> Although it is important to make sure you understand the risks associated with disabling SSL verification and ensure compliance with company policies. Installing Python packages locally/ offline \u00b6 It may be easier to download and install the package locally. Steps: 1. Download the files for the Coin Metrics API Client from PyPi 2. Install it locally Requests Proxy \u00b6 Sometimes your organization has special rules on making requests to third parties and you have to use proxies in order to comply with the rules. For proxies that don't require auth you can specify them similar to this example: client = CoinMetricsClient ( proxy_url = f 'http://<hostname>:<port>' ) For proxies that require auth, you should be able to specify username and password similar to this example: client = CoinMetricsClient ( proxy_url = f 'http://<username>:<password>@<hostname>:<port>' ) Extended documentation \u00b6 For more information about the available methods in the client please reference API Client Spec","title":"Home"},{"location":"index.html#coin-metrics-python-api-v4-client-library","text":"This is an official Python API client for Coin Metrics API v4.","title":"Coin Metrics Python API v4 client library"},{"location":"index.html#installation-and-updates","text":"To install the client you can run the following command: pip install coinmetrics-api-client Note that the client is updated regularly to reflect the changes made in API v4 .

If you wish to dig even deeper, you may consider modifying the _send_request() method of the API Client to log additional data about the state of your environment, or anything else that would help diagnose issues. You will notice a log file generated in the format cm_api_client_debug_2023_01_09_11_01_02.txt .

Additionally, you have the option of passing it in which each command instead. To confirm the tool is installed correct execute the command coinmetrics export --help which brings up relevant documentation. At the bottom of the help message all the available commands are shown: Commands: get-asset-pairs get-exchanges market-candles-future Used to export data related to future market... market-candles-spot Used to export data related to spot market candles. market-quotes-future Used to export data related to future market... market-quotes-spot Used to export data related to spot market quotes... market-trades-future Used to export data related to future market... market-trades-spot Used to export data related to spot market trades.

If you instead wish to download the data as a csv or json you can use: coinmetrics export market-trades-spot binance,coinbase 2022-06-01 2022-06-05 --output-format csv The functionality for getting future, rather than spot market trades is the exact same, just replace market-trades-spot with market-trades-future In order to figure out what exchanges are supported for a flat file type you can run coinmetrics export get-exchanges <command> , so in this case running coinmetrics export get-exchanges market-trades-spot Exporting market quotes \u00b6 Market quotes are similar to market trades, except data is separated by exchange and by asset-pair. So you must provide both what exchanges you are querying as well the specific asset pairs. Example if you wanted to export files to market quotes for ETHUSDT and BTCUSDT over a certain timeframe as json files: coinmetrics export market-quotes-spot binance ETHUSDT,BTCUSDT 2022-03-03 2022-03-05 --output-format json In order to find what asset pairs are availible you can query this information with coinmetrics export get-asset-pairs <command> <exchange> so in this case, for Binance you would run coinmetrics export get-asset-pairs market-quotes-spot binance . If you are comfortable with command line tools it may be helpful to string this with unix command line tools like grep . For example, to find all the BTC related pairs for binance you might run coinmetrics export get-asset-pairs market-quotes-spot binance | grep BTC . The functionality is the same for market-qutoes-futures . Exporting market candles \u00b6 Exporting market candles also functions similar to market trades, however you must specify a frequency in addition to an exchange and date range. The frequency denominates the range which the market candles cover. These frequencies are currently \"1m\", \"5m\", \"10m\", \"15m\", \"30m\", \"1h\", and \"1d\" . Example to download 5m spot market candles for coinbase and binance for a date range: coinmetrics export market-candles-spot 5m coinbase,binance 2022-01-01 2022-01-05 Which creates these files: market-candles-spot-5m \u251c\u2500\u2500 binance \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 2022-01-01.json.gz \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 2022-01-02.json.gz \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 2022-01-03.json.gz \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 2022-01-04.json.gz \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 2022-01-05.json.gz \u2514\u2500\u2500 coinbase \u251c\u2500\u2500 2022-01-01.json.gz \u251c\u2500\u2500 2022-01-02.json.gz \u251c\u2500\u2500 2022-01-03.json.gz \u251c\u2500\u2500 2022-01-04.json.gz \u2514\u2500\u2500 2022-01-05.json.gz The functionality is the same for market-candles-future Using API Key without setting an environment variable \u00b6 If you don't wish to put your CoinMetrics API key in your environment, you may also pass it in with any command with the flag --api-key . Example: coinmetrics export market-candles-spot 5m coinbase,binance 2022-01-01 2022-01-05 --api-key <API_KEY> Downloading files in parallel \u00b6 If you are downloading many files and want to speed the process up there is an option to concurrently download multiple rather than one at a time, using the --threaded flag. Example: coinmetrics export market-candles-spot 5m coinbase,binance 2022-01-01 2022-01-05 --threaded Note that using this option will consume more system resources and network bandwith, and the download speed will still be limited by egress from the files server as well as the specs of your machine. Using the CoinMetricsDataExporter in Python instead of CLI \u00b6 Depending on the use case it might be more convenient to use the CoinMetricsDataExporter directly in Python rather than from the CLI.
